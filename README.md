# odin-recipes
Simple project that should consist of just a main index page and some links
to recipes.
It should serve as a practice to building HTML chops.
UPD:
Well, that actually helped. Now things i learned feel more clear.
It still looks horrendous and took a lot of time, but i feel like i'm actually improving.
